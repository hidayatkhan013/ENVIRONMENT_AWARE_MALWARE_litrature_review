Dynamic analysis on a virtual computer is a frequent technique for analyzing possibly dangerous 
software. The behavior of malware when it is executed in a VM is therefore modified by the 
virus's designers via various approaches. But how exactly do they accomplish it?
Dynamic analysis is a popular method for analyzing software that may be dangerous. The binary 
is run in an analysis environment—typically a Virtual Machine (VM)—and the behavior it 
exhibits while running in the system is examined. Knowing this, malware authors work to 
prevent it by concealing their dangerous purpose during analysis. The virus must determine that 
it is operating within a VM in order to be able to achieve this. For this, there are many different 
detection techniques, which we will go over in more detail. In light of this, we also examined the 
use of VM detection techniques on 50,000 [1] malware samples. Low-level methods such as 
examining hardware and network information, malware can also use high-level methods that 
utilize the Windows API to detect whether it is running in a virtual machine. For example, 
malware can use the RegOpenKey function to search for specific registry keys that may indicate 
the presence of a virtual machine. This is just one example of how malware can use the Windows 
API to detect its environment. Malware authors are always coming up with new ways to detect 
their environment, and as a result, it can be challenging for antivirus software and other security 
tools to keep update. For this reason, it's important to use a combination of different techniques 
and approaches to detect and protect against malware. Another trend that malware authors have 
been using is to utilize Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes to retrieve 
information about the system. The MSAcpi_Thermal Zone Temperature class can be used to 
check for the presence of a virtual machine, by examining the Current Temperature property. If 
this property is not supported, it is likely that the malware is running in a virtual machine, as 
virtual machines do not have hardware that can be used to measure temperature. This is just 
another example of how malware can use WMI classes to detect its environment. Some other
methods that can be used to check for system artifacts indicating the presence of a hypervisor or 
other virtualization software[2]. For example, malware can use WMI classes to check for the 
presence of virtualization tools or specific registry keys that may indicate the presence of a 
virtual machine. Some of the technique discussed in [3] and [4] are listed following
